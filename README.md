## Description
This is an e-commerce back end application.

## Installation
To install, travel to my github, and use my code! 

## Usage 
To USE my code, all you have to do is type '**npm run seed**' into the integrated terminal to seed your database with the table data!!

Then you can type '**npm start**' and it will start listening on your desired server!

This is an example of the application data being read using Insomnia.
